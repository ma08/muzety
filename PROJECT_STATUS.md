   - [ ] Cultural context on hover

### Priority 3: Freestyle Showcase (20 mins)
1. **Deploy to Freestyle**
   - [ ] Run `npm run deploy:freestyle`
   - [ ] Get `.style.dev` URL
   - [ ] Test performance on Freestyle infrastructure

2. **Serverless Functions**
   - [ ] Move etymology processing to Freestyle Execute
   - [ ] Implement caching strategy
   - [ ] Add telemetry for demo

3. **Dynamic Component Generation**
   - [ ] Generate unique visualizations per song
   - [ ] Store in Freestyle Git
   - [ ] Version control for generated UI

## üìä Demo Script

### Opening (30 seconds)
1. Show app running with "Mast Malang" playing
2. Point out autonomous reaction to audio (no human input)
3. Highlight Freestyle infrastructure powering backend

### Core Features (1 minute)
1. **Lyrics Sync**: Show real-time highlighting
2. **Etymology**: Hover over "‡§Æ‡§≤‡§Ç‡§ó" - show Persian origin
3. **Sentiment**: Watch background change with emotion
4. **Particles**: Point out different effects per mood

### Technical Deep Dive (30 seconds)
1. Show Wiktionary API integration
2. Demonstrate AI fallback for unknown words
3. Explain Freestyle's role in serverless processing

### Closing (30 seconds)
1. Emphasize hackathon categories fit
2. Show potential for other languages/songs
3. Mention scalability with Freestyle

## üéØ Hackathon Requirements Checklist

### Autonomous Reactive Agents ‚úÖ
- [x] Responds to audio timestamps (non-human signal)
- [x] Automatically adapts UI based on lyrics
- [x] No human prompts needed at runtime
- [x] Fetches etymology data autonomously

### Just-in-Time Software ‚úÖ
- [x] UI changes dynamically as song plays
- [x] Each lyric line gets unique visualization
- [x] Real-time sentiment analysis
- [x] Context-aware translations

### Freestyle Integration ‚úÖ
- [x] Freestyle SDK installed and configured

## üöÄ Quick Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start local server

# Deployment
npm run deploy:freestyle # Deploy to Freestyle (REQUIRED!)

# Testing
# Open browser console to check for errors
# Test on different screen sizes
```

## üìù Notes for Demo Day

1. **Start audio immediately** - Show autonomous behavior
2. **Hover over Hindi words** - Demonstrate etymology
3. **Mention Freestyle multiple times** - Prize eligibility
4. **Show mobile view** - Responsive design
5. **Have backup** - Pre-record demo video just in case
